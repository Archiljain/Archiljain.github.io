This week I forked the QuizAI repository, set up the local environment, and prepared a clean PR that integrates the Gemini API with `.env` key management. Also cleaned up pre-existing dark mode features to avoid conflict.Added a showHistory feature to the repo.

## Highlights
- API key handling with security.
- Read through the maintainer's comments and responded with technical clarifications.
- Understood the structure of Flask backend + React frontend.
- Added a showHistory feature.
